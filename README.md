# The Constitution

This is the one and only [United States Constitution](constitution.md),
reimagined in the technology built for managing living documents: git.

Each time the constitution changed, it's a new commit.
You should read it, view the commit history and diffs,
and if you don't star this repo, you are not a true patriot.
